    ## Yo dawg, you just got served!

    ### Views & Layouts
    
    Your views are stored in the <kbd>views</kbd> folder. Coming from a page-based
    scripting language like PHP? Views are just like regular pages. The main layout
    file for this project is stored in <kbd>layouts/default</kbd>.
    
    ### Stylesheets, Sass &amp; Compass
    
    This project is pre-configured for [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and
    [Compass](http://compass-style.org). Store your <kbd>sass</kbd> and
    <kbd>scss</kbd> files in the root <kbd>stylesheets</kbd> folder. Sass
    stylesheets will be automatically compiled to CSS and stored in
    <kbd>public/stylesheets</kbd>.
    
    ### Static Assets
    
    Static assets like images, javascripts, and downloads are stored in the
    <kbd>public</kbd> folder. Put files here that don&#8217;t need special
    processing by Serve.
    
    ### Other Template Languages
    
    If you are interested in using Serve with other template languages like Haml,
    Slim, Markdown, or Textile, remember to edit the project <kbd>Gemfile</kbd>
    to include the appropriate gems. Then use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) 
    to install them.
    
    ### Compass Plugins
    
    Serve Bootstrap includes support for [960.gs](http://960.gs/) & 
    [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/). To use them, you'll need to edit the 
    <kbd>Gemfile</kbd> and <kbd>compass.config</kbd> to include the appropriate 
    gems. Then, just like template languages, use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) 
    to install. Uncomment the appropriate lines in the <kbd>screen.sass</kbd> 
    stylesheet to import.
