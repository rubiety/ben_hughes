What is this?
=============

Serve Bootstrap is a stripped-down website prototype starting point that's 
designed to be viewed with [Serve](http://get-serve.com/).

It features [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), Haml, Sass, 
your choice of grid frameworks, and lots of best practices.


How do I install and run Serve?
-------------------------------

Serve is distributed as a Ruby gem to make it easy to get up and running. You
must have Ruby installed in order to download and use Serve. The Ruby download
page provides instructions for getting Ruby setup on different platforms:

<http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>

After you have Ruby installed, open up the command prompt and type:

    gem install serve

(OSX and Unix users may need to prefix the command with `sudo`.)

After Serve is installed, you can start it up in a given directory like this:

    serve

This will start Serve on port 4000. You can now view the prototype in your
Web browser at this URL:

<http://localhost:4000>


RubyGems
--------

This prototype uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org) & 
[Sass](http://sass-lang.org) to generate CSS, and Haml & Markdown 
to generate HTML. Because we're using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), we 
can install all the required gems by typing:

    bundle install

Rack and Passenger
------------------

Astute users may notice that this project is also a simple Rack application.
This means that it is easy to deploy it on Passenger or in any other
Rack-friendly environment. Rack it up with the `rackup` command. For more
information about using Serve and Passenger see:

Exporting
---------

To export this project to pure HTML and CSS you will need the prerelease
version of Serve. To get started with the prerelease version:

    gem install --pre serve

To export your project, use the new "export" command:

    serve export <project>:<output>

Where "project" is the path to the project and "output" is the path to the
directory where you would like your HTML and CSS generated.
